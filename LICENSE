ACADEMIC USE NOTICE

This software was developed as part of an MSc dissertation project. If you use
this work in academic research or publications, please provide appropriate
attribution by citing the accompanying dissertation report (MSc-Project-Report.md).

The orbital mechanics calculations and educational design principles implemented
in this software are based on published academic work and textbooks. Users are
encouraged to consult the original sources for deeper understanding:

- Curtis, H. D. (2013). Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students (3rd ed.)
- Mayer, R. E., & Moreno, R. (2003). Nine Ways to Reduce Cognitive Load in
  Multimedia Learning

  Intervention Strategies

DISCLAIMER

This software is designed for educational purposes. Whilst the orbital mechanics
calculations are validated against theoretical predictions and reference
implementations, this is NOT intended for mission-critical applications or
operational spacecraft trajectory planning. The software implements simplified
two-body dynamics and does not include perturbations, relativistic effects, or
other factors required for high-precision orbital determination.

Always validate results with professional-grade astrodynamics software (e.g.,
GMAT, STK) before using for any practical applications.
